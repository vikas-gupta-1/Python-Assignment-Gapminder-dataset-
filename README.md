**Python Individual Assignment - Gapminder Dataset Analysis**
Overview
This repository contains the code for the individual Python assignment focusing on the analysis of the Gapminder dataset. The assignment includes tasks such as:

- Describing variables
- Visualizing variables of interest
- Running a simple regression and interpreting its results
- Discussing endogeneity and suitable identification strategies
**Dataset**
The dataset used for this assignment is the Gapminder dataset stored in excel file, which includes data on life expectancy, GDP per capita, population, and other variables across multiple countries.

Key Variables:
Country: Name of the country
Continent: Continent where the country is located
Year: The year data was collected
Life Expectancy: Life expectancy at birth (in years)
Population: Population of the country
GDP per Capita: Gross Domestic Product per capita (inflation-adjusted, in US$)
Project Structure
The code is organized in a Jupyter notebook (P.ipynb), where the analysis is carried out. The notebook contains:

Data Loading and Inspection: The Gapminder dataset is loaded, and basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed.
Descriptive Statistics: Summaries of variables including types and units of measurement are provided.
Visualizations: Two types of graphs are created to visualize the relationships between continuous and categorical variables using seaborn and matplotlib.
Regression Analysis: Simple regression models are implemented to explore the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy.
Endogeneity Discussion: Potential causes of endogeneity and suitable solutions are discussed.

**Part I: Variable Descriptions**
The Gapminder dataset contains both continuous (e.g., life expectancy, GDP per capita) and discrete (e.g., population, year) variables. Categorical variables include country and continent.
The dataset consists of 1,704 rows and 6 columns.

**Part II: Visualizations**
Count Plot: Displays the number of observations per continent.
Histogram: Displays the distribution of log-transformed GDP per capita.

**Part III: Summary Statistics**
Summary statistics for categorical and continuous variables are calculated, and interesting observations are made, such as the wide disparity in GDP per capita and life expectancy across countries.

**Part IV: Regression Analysis**
Two regression models are estimated:

A model with only GDP per capita.
A model adding population as a control variable. Both models are discussed in terms of their coefficients, statistical significance, and R-squared values.

**Part V: Endogeneity Discussion**
The potential causes of endogeneity in the regression models are discussed, including omitted variable bias, simultaneity (reverse causality), and selection bias. Mitigation strategies such as using instrumental variables and lagged variables are suggested.

**Conclusion**
This analysis provides insights into the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy across countries. The results highlight the importance of controlling for confounding variables and addressing endogeneity when estimating causal relationships in economic data.

**Learnings**

1. Understanding Data Types and Units of Measurement
You learned how to describe and categorize variables into continuous, discrete, and categorical types.
For example, continuous variables like GDP per capita and life expectancy were represented as float64, while discrete variables like year and population were represented as int64. Categorical variables like country and continent were strings (objects).
You also learned how to describe the units of measurement for each variable, such as life expectancy in years and GDP per capita in US dollars (inflation-adjusted).

2. Data Visualization Techniques
You gained experience in visualizing data using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn.
By creating count plots and histograms, you were able to see the distribution of data across different continents and examine the density distribution of GDP per capita.
The process also involved labeling graphs with titles, axis labels, legends, and adding figure captions for clarity.

3. Summarizing Data with Descriptive Statistics
You applied describe() to generate summary statistics such as mean, standard deviation, min, max, and count for both continuous and categorical variables.
You were able to observe patterns like the wide range in GDP per capita and the variation in population size across different countries and continents.

4. Regression Analysis and Interpretation
You performed regression analysis to study the relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita, with the added control of population size.
This process helped you understand how to build a regression model and interpret the coefficients. You saw that adding population as a control variable improved the explanatory power (R-squared) of the model.
You also explored the statistical significance of coefficients (through p-values) and discussed the implications of the signs of the coefficients.

5. Endogeneity in Regression Analysis
The assignment taught you the concept of endogeneity, which occurs when independent variables are correlated with the error term in a regression model.
You learned about different causes of endogeneity, such as omitted variable bias (e.g., missing key variables like education or healthcare), simultaneity (where causality goes both ways), and selection bias (biased data sampling).
You also explored strategies for mitigating endogeneity, like using instrumental variables or lagged variables.

6. Critical Thinking and Causal Inference
The assignment emphasized the importance of considering causal relationships when interpreting regression results.
It helped you think critically about the variables that should be controlled for in order to avoid biases and improve the accuracy of the results.

7. Using Python for Statistical Analysis
You gained proficiency in using Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and statsmodels for data analysis and statistical modeling.
The assignment also provided hands-on experience with handling Excel datasets, performing data cleaning, and generating regression summaries.

8. Reporting and Communicating Findings
The assignment reinforced the importance of presenting your findings clearly, with tables, figures, and proper interpretation of results.
You also learned how to discuss the significance of your results and potential limitations in a thorough and structured manner.
